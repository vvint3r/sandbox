We are here to provide local businesses with everything they need to win. Get more reviews, collect payments, send text marketing campaigns, and centralize your communications—all from one easy-to-use platform.

This is how we coined the term, the Subscription Economy®.

Today, we see others evangelizing this term, and building entire communities around it. The Subscription Economy isn't (and never was) just about subscription business models but, direct, recurring relationships with customers through any business model. Subscriptions were only just scratching the surface and now, the market recognizes the Subscription Economy for what it truly is-a relationship-centric economy. Companies have realized that the path to growth going forward is to establish direct, digital relationships with their customers, and to nurture and monetize these relationships through an ever growing set of digital services.

Alongside this evolution, Zuora has been there every step of the way. We started with Zuora Billing, and have expanded our award-winning multi-product portfolio to include Zuora Revenue, Zuora Payments and Zuora Central Platform. More recently, we've added subscription experience platform Zephr to our family, further expanding our capabilities to serve as an intelligent hub that monetizes the complete quote to cash and revenue recognition process at scale.

Back in 2000, OEMs were facing a huge hurdle selling parts into dealerships, mechanical shops, and collision shops. Every transaction was handled manually, either by phone or fax, which left the market desperate for a faster, more efficient way to do business. 

That's when four major auto players – GM, Ford, Chrysler, and Bell & Howell (now Snap-on Business Solutions) – formed OEC. In 2001, we launched CollisionLink, the first e-commerce tool for shops to buy OE parts from dealership suppliers. Shortly afterwards, we launched D2DLink, connecting dealers nationwide and quickly elevating the OEC dealership base from 500 to 10,000. Over the years, we continued to develop and acquire key solutions to better manage every aspect of maintenance and repair, including non-OE aftermarket parts and solutions for repairers. 

Today, OEC is how everyone in the vehicle parts and repair lifecycle gets their job done more easily. Dealers and suppliers, repairers, manufacturers, insurers, and fleets all use our technology and data services to connect with each other and get vehicles back on the road safely. It's why so many of the biggest names in the industry all rely on OEC.

Back in 2000, OEMs were facing a huge hurdle selling parts into dealerships, mechanical shops, and collision shops. Every transaction was handled manually, either by phone or fax, which left the market desperate for a faster, more efficient way to do business. 

That's when four major auto players – GM, Ford, Chrysler, and Bell & Howell (now Snap-on Business Solutions) – formed OEC. In 2001, we launched CollisionLink, the first e-commerce tool for shops to buy OE parts from dealership suppliers. Shortly afterwards, we launched D2DLink, connecting dealers nationwide and quickly elevating the OEC dealership base from 500 to 10,000. Over the years, we continued to develop and acquire key solutions to better manage every aspect of maintenance and repair, including non-OE aftermarket parts and solutions for repairers. 

Today, OEC is how everyone in the vehicle parts and repair lifecycle gets their job done more easily. Dealers and suppliers, repairers, manufacturers, insurers, and fleets all use our technology and data services to connect with each other and get vehicles back on the road safely. It's why so many of the biggest names in the industry all rely on OEC. And it's how, in just the past year alone, we've facilitated over $11B in North American e-commerce and over $30B in global trade.

Businesses are moving from asking, ""What happened?"" to predicting what's coming, solving problems before they start and using data to unlock opportunities. 

At LogicMonitor, we're committed to expanding what's possible for businesses by advancing their technology. After all, monitoring shouldn't just help businesses see what's in front of them—it should create new ways for them to grow. Here's how we live our vision:

Turn It On - Today, monitoring keeps the world of business turning. LogicMonitor comprehensively monitors infrastructures, from on-premises to the cloud. Within minutes, we make it possible for businesses to advance their technology, ensuring airline passengers aren't stranded due to system outages, food stays at safe temperatures and spinning wheels don't interrupt our favorite streaming shows.

Turn the Dial - We believe monitoring should do more than visualize today's information—it should open up new ways for businesses to grow. We go above and beyond to empower our customers, seeking to be the most extensible monitoring platform in the world. When our customers can solve problems before they start, they can move their focus from maintenance to innovation.

Turn the Corner - As artificial intelligence and machine learning turn from sci-fi promises to everyday realities, our technology is enabling businesses to see what's coming before it happens. We collaborate closely with our customers to understand their risks and anticipate their needs, providing insights that unlock their vision.

Our company has a global presence with offices in Santa Barbara, Austin, London, India, Australia, and Singapore.",2007.0,https://zenprospect-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/pictures/672e07c83630ed00019ac93c/picture

From our humble beginning as core contributors to Apache Maven, to supporting the world's largest repository of open source components (Central), to distributing the world's most popular repository manager (Sonatype Nexus Repository), we've played a meaningful role in helping the world embrace the power of open innovation.

Over time, we witnessed the staggering volume and variety of open source libraries that began flowing into every development environment in the world. We understood that when open source components are properly managed, they provide a tremendous energy for accelerating innovation.  Conversely, when unmanaged, open source ""gone wild""​ can lead directly to security vulnerabilities, licensing risks, enormous rework, and waste.

Our vision today is simple.

We are laser focused on helping organizations continuously harness all of the good that open source has to offer, without any of the risk. In order to do this, we have invested in knowing more about the quality of open source than anyone else in the world. This investment takes the form of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and human expertise, which in aggregate produces highly curated intelligence that is infused into every Sonatype product. Organizations equipped with Sonatype products make better decisions, innovate faster at scale, and rest comfortably knowing that their applications always consist of the highest quality open source components.",2008.0,https://zenprospect-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/pictures/672fe6b3a62a7b00016fa1da/picture

AOI is a leading designer and manufacturer of fiber optic networking products. We primarily serve three growing end-markets: cable television broadband, fiber-to-the-home, and internet data centers. We are vertically integrated with a product portfolio from laser chips, components, sub-assemblies and modules, to complete turn-key equipment. 

All three of our end-markets are driven by bandwidth demand fueled by the growth of network connected devices, such as video traffic, cloud computing and online social networking. To address this increased demand, CATV and telecommunications service providers are investing to improve their networks in competition to deliver  voice, video, and data services to their subscribers. Rising bandwidth consumption is also driving demand for higher speed server connections in the internet data center market. As a result of these trends, fiber optic networking technology has become fundamental in all three of our target markets to meet these needs.

Our vertical integration, broad product lines, and in-house design capability uniquely position AOI to serve these markets and offer us the flexibility to address tomorrow's fiber optic applications.

It can be as simple as data entry of forms like keying warranty cards, rebate forms, or any other hand written application form, or capturing the same data from a caller. It often involves complex rules based processes where IIMI personnel read and understand the content, make rules based decisions, validate the data with other sources that may be offline or online, and perform audit and analysis of the data for items such as expense report validation, insurance eligibility verification enrollment and claims processing; invoice payments, reporting and database creation, or research and statistical analysis.  Whether working completely behind the scenes, or playing a more active role, IIMI has the depth and breadth of capability to support our customers across multiple geographies and languages.

Usually any work process that is people dependent, transaction intensive, very much routine and repetitive, and which can be processed remotely or off-site can be easily outsourced to IIMI at a fraction of the cost of doing it yourself. Today, utilizing VOIP and/or Internet connectivity, and the simple, secure portability of scanned images make remote processing of many tasks practical and affordable.

In the communications landscape of Louisiana, a handful of nimble providers emerged as local leaders in next-generation internet. These pioneers demonstrated that they could establish larger fiber networks, give better service and deliver more value by focusing on customers and innovation.

The original companies that would later form REV included:

RTC, originally in Reserve, LA, was founded in 1935 as a single phone line and that has now expanded throughout the entire region.
EATEL, originally in Ascension Parish, successfully launched one of the only 100 percent fiber-to-the-home networks in the country.
And Vision Communications, who originally served Lafourche Parish and the Grand Isle communities by expanding fiber and gig-speed internet to some of the most southern parts of the state.
Although the service areas of the three companies were geographically distant, their values and commitment to customers were nearly identical.

In 2011, EATEL acquired Vision Communications, after recognizing the potential for an even larger network. Then later in 2019, RTC and EATEL merged, becoming one of the largest local providers in Louisiana.",1935.0,https://zenprospect-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/pictures/672ea276b35ae80001e9fe74/picture
